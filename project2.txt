1. Read in city names and distances from files.
2. Start at a random city.
3. While there are still unvisited cities:
    a. Find the nearest unvisited city.
    b. Add the distance to the total distance.
    c. Mark the city as visited.
    d. Update the current city to the nearest unvisited city.
4. Add the distance from the last city visited back to the starting city.
5. Return the tour and total distance.


1. Read in city names and distances from files.
2. Generate a random initial solution.
3. While the stopping criterion is not met:
    a. Choose two random cities in the solution.
    b. Swap the cities in the solution.
    c. If the new solution is better, accept it.
    d. If the new solution is worse, accept it with some probability (determined by a temperature parameter).
    e. Update the temperature parameter.
4. Return the best solution found and its total distance.
